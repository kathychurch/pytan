Filters Help
============

Filters are used generously throughout pytan. When used as part of a
sensor string, they control what data is shown for the columns that
the sensor returns. When filters are used for whole question filters,
they control what rows will be returned. They are used by Groups to
define group membership, deploy actions to determine which machines
should have the action deployed to it, and more.

A filter string is a human string that describes, a sensor followed
by ', that FILTER:VALUE', where FILTER is a valid filter string,
and VALUE is the string that you want FILTER to match on.
